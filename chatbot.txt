Otherwise it would give you this nasty CORS error: "Access to script at 'file:///C:/Users/HP%20EliteBook/Desktop/CIT261/CIT-261-master/chatbot/chatbot.js' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https."
